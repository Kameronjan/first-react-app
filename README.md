My first ever interaction with react. This is a simple program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

Mini project from codecademy where I was provided a list of tasks to complete in order for the project to be finished. I had mini hints if I wasn't sure on a step but if I really got stuck somewhere, I was forced to do my own research to try and figure out the issue as I Was not provided any other hints or help.
